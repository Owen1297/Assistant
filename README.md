# How To Use
Simply press ALT+A at any time, and it will open a quick-ask window

# **!READ! !IMPORTANT!**
if the CMD window is closed, it wont work, if you close it, dont worry, the installer creates a desktop shortcut to run it

# Dont have a Gemini API?
its free! all you have to do is go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey and sign in, create a API key, and **BOOM** you have one ready-to-paste

# Worried about the security of your API key?
the api key is securely stored in a txt file in C:Users\YOU\OneDrive\Documents\assistant\src

# DEPENDENCIES: NONE
the installer installs python if you don't have it, along with all the neccissary modules either way!
